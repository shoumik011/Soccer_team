# Soccer_team
**Object-Oriented Design:** Demonstrated proficiency in designing and implementing classes (`SoccerTeam`, `Player`, and `Coach`) using object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

**Constructor Variations:** Successfully created multiple constructors for the `SoccerTeam` and `Player` classes, including default, overloaded, and copy constructors, allowing for versatile object creation and deep copying of object attributes.

**Static Factory Methods:** Implemented static factory methods in `SoccerTeam`, `Player`, and `Coach` classes, providing alternative ways to instantiate objects and ensuring consistent object creation across the codebase.

**Deep Copying:** Implemented deep copying techniques within setters and copy constructors, ensuring the integrity of object attributes while avoiding unintended modifications due to reference sharing.

 **Encapsulation:** Maintained data integrity by encapsulating class attributes and providing appropriate getter and setter methods, enforcing controlled access to class attributes.

**Singleton Pattern:** Employed the Singleton pattern for the `Coach` class using a static method (`getInstance()`) to ensure a single instance of the coach exists within the application.

**Code Reusability:** Utilized methods such as `getPlayers()`, `getCoach()`, `setPlayers()`, `setCoach()`, `getName()`, `getYearsExp()`, `getLevel()`, etc., to access and modify class attributes, promoting code reusability and readability.

**Documentation:** Maintained clear and concise documentation through Javadoc comments, facilitating understanding and usage of the implemented classes and methods by other developers.

**Exception Handling:** Implemented exception handling techniques where appropriate, ensuring robustness and reliability of the code by handling potential errors during object instantiation and attribute manipulation.

**Role Representation:** Utilized specific character representations ('d', 'c', 's', 'g') to define player roles, enhancing code readability and facilitating role-based functionalities within the soccer team structure.
